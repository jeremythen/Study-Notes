# Containers

Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and **are required when using our default grid system**.


## Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

* .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
* .container-fluid, aka Responsive container, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
* .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

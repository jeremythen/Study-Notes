# EA (Enterprise Architecture)

## Enterprise

Is an organization that uses software systems. Any entity comprised to people, working collectively towards a goal, is an enterprise.

## Architecture

The manner in which the components of a computer or computer system are organized and integrated.

## EA

Deals with the complex relationship between the enterprise application, its users, the bussiness processes and the systems that automate those processes.

# Enterprise Architects

Translate bussiness strategy into real systems.

Misscomunication between enterprise and developers may lead to poor and expensive results. So, EA is the middleman that translate bussiness process to IT solutions.

EA department has the time to design and connect the bussiness needs with the IT solutions. In small companies or companies without EAs, software leads do little EA, but they don't have the time to fully engage, understand and implement the necessary connection. EA department is dedicated to it.

## Some of the EA decisions:

* Do we need a system?
* Should we build a new one?
* Should we buy a new a system, get existing platforms?
* What are the risk of failure?
* How do we mitigate the risk?

## Business Architecture

Is the strategy and business process of an enterprise.

Having a defined business architecture allows management to prioritize work.

The bussiness strategy is *what the company wants to achieve* (eg: reduce cost of operation).
The architect's job is to design the solution for that strategy (eg: analizing the existing systems and processes, modifications, probably the creation of a new system to automate processes, etc).

Architects design Roadmaps (Landscape) to express long-term evolution, shows presentation of solutions, etc.
EA team uses the Roadmap to plan strategies ahead of time, usually 12 to 18 months.

Writing code is not the solution to all problems.
Sometimes problems can be fixed with process changes, or conversations.
Architects determine if the software is really needed, analize and make decisions.

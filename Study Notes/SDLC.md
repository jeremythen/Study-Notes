# Waterfall

* Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase N

## Cicle

* Requirements
* Analysis and Design
* Development
* Test
* Development and Maintenance

## Cons

* Late delivery of business value
* Frozen requirements (change orders)

## Impact of Waterfall

* Project failures
* Comprehensive documentation (but is not good enough to have a good documentation when the software is not working propertly. Stakeholders don't understand the technical doc anyways)

## Applicable Scenerios
* Simple systems
* Enhancements in ongoing maintenance
* Mission critical


# Spiral model (a mix between waterfall and iterative development)

## Phases

* Planning
* Risk Analysis (build prototypes to mitigate risks)
* Engineering (software development, testing, etc)
* Evaluation (stakeholder review, feedback and plan new iteration)

# Terms
* Rational Unified Process (RUP)
* UML
* Dynamic System Development Method (early Agile)
* Agile
* DSDM Consortium
* Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
* Crystal Methods (family of methodologies)
* Lean Software Development
* Value Stream Mapping (VSM)
* Lead Time vs Cycle Time
* Kanban
* Litle's Law
* Extreme Programming (XP) (focused on short weekly iterations)
* Spotify Agile Model
* Kata Board
* (WIP) Work In Progress
* CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)
* Six Sigma
* 

# FDD

## FDD Life Cycle

* Develop overall model
* Build feature list
* Plan by feature
* Design by feature
* Build by feature

# Scrum

A lightweight, agile framework, simple and features an iterative and incremental approach (short sprint).
